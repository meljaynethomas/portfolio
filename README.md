INTRODUCTION TO MY PORTFOLIO PROJECT

The design of my portfolio is based on the image/symbol of the dandelion. I feel the dandelion is a good representation of me as a person and a designer. Various sources indicate the dandelion symbolises perseverance, endurance and determination. These are qualities I see in myself on my journey from healthcare professional to software developer. Dandelions are also an example of resourcefulness and great design, having developed creative methods of scattering their own seeds. In addition, they are simply bright, sunny and cheerful!

In terms of the colour palette, rather than vivid yellows and greens associated with the dandelion, I have selected muted complementary versions of these colours in order to achieve a more calming/serene mood. I also wanted a minimalist design, with lots of white space and few distractions. I was aiming for a clean, sharp look.
